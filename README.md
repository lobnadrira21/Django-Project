This project was developed during my internship at a company. It focuses on resellers who manage client contracts.
The administrator has the authority to either approve or reject contracts.
Once a contract is approved, the reseller can generate and download an invoice in PDF format. Additionally, the administrator can view statistics for the invoices that have been created
